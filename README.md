# md-slides-pdf-exporter

An exporter image for [md-slides](github.com/AstromechZA/md-slides) for rendering slides as PDF.

This is an optional add-on that is downloaded when required.

It is an unfortunately large image (~366MB) due to encapsulating `chromium` as well as a variety of text rendering packages. This is part of the reason why it is delivered as an add-on.

```
$ docker pull astromech/md-slides-pdf-exporter:latest
```
